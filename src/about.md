# About

ðŸ‘‹ Hello I am Arthur, a Dutch game developer with interests in graphics, low level programming and reverse engineering.

Here I post my projects, blog a bit and say hello to the world.

---
I started on [Grafisch Lyceum Utrecht](https://www.glu.nl/) in 2019. 

I did a internship at Triangle Factory for half a year and worked on [Breachers](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1922010/Breachers/) as a developer.

Right now I am studying at Howest [DAE](https://digitalartsandentertainment.be/) game development in Belgium.
